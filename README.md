# trivalibs-rs

Shared Rust libraries used for graphics programming targeting WebAssembly and desktop.

## Language lines

This is the Rust line of trivalibs: multi-target, with fast native code. Its
painter was the model for
[trivalibs-scala](https://github.com/trival/scala-trivalibs), a Scala.js port
for WebGPU in the browser with a similar API. For anything that targets the
web, prefer trivalibs-scala. This line stays available for native apps.

## shader crates in trivalibs-painter

Shaders are compiled from Rust to rspirv shaders using [cargo-gpu](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/cargo-gpu).

To compile a shader crate, run `cargo gpu build` in the crate directory.

To watch compile, install `watchexec` and run `watchexec -r -e rs cargo gpu build` in the shader crate directory.
